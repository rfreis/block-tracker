# Introduction

This is an Open Source project with the goal to track wallet's transactions and the portfolio values over time.

Block Tracker uses `Django`, `Celery` and `Postgresql`.

# Supported protocols

Initially it supports only Bitcoin with P2PKH/P2WPKH addresses. The project aims to support multiple assets in multiple protocols.

# Requirements

To make this run you must have installed:

* docker
* docker-compose

# Development

Before commiting new changes, make sure you have `pre-commit` installed:

```bash
make pre-commit-install
```

# Running application

```bash
make start-local
```

For the first time, you can use `make build` to download and build the containers.

# Stopping application

```bash
make stop
```

# Local bash

```bash
make local-bash
```

# Logs

```bash
make logs
```

# Tests

```bash
make test # shortcut to e2e and unit tests
make unit
make e2e
make integration
```

# Emails

We use [mailhog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog) to display the emails sent by SMTP on development server.

The emails sent to SMTP server on `localhost:1025` gets available on [localhost:8025](http://localhost:8025).

# Workers

## Blockbook websocket

```bash
python manage.py wss_blockbook <ProtocolType attribute>
python manage.py wss_blockbook BITCOIN
python manage.py wss_blockbook BITCOIN_TESTNET
```

## Celery workers

```bash
python -m celery -A app worker
python -m celery -A app beat -l info
```

# Exchange rates

We use [Coingecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation) to fetch exchange rates. We try to get a daily rate for the max period as possible and a 5 minutes rate using the `celery beat & worker`.
